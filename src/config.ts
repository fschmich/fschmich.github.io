  aboutMe:
    "Computational Biology PhD with 15+ years of expertise in machine learning and 8+ years in pharmaceutical R\&D, I currently work as a Senior Principal Data Scientist and AI Capability Lead at Roche. In these roles, I lead global cross-functional teams to tackle complex biological and clinical challenges, working on cutting-edge projects like clinical digital twins and lab-in-the-loop generative design for gene therapy. My hands-on approach to project and portfolio work ensures the successful execution of complex, high-risk initiatives, leveraging my deep expertise in AI/ML and leadership to deliver impactful solutions. Responsible for overseeing PhD and Postdoc programmes, I co-founded a graduate school and currently establish an independent research group focused on AI for gene therapy design. As a lifelong learner with a can-do attitude, I am passionate about making a positive impact on patient lives.",

        "I run a local weather station using a Davis Vantage Pro 2 with wind, rain, temperature and radiation sensors and a Raspberry Pi with weewx as backend. Utilizing a robust wireless weather station for data acquisition, information is transmitted to a dedicated local server. On the software side, I've implemented a comprehensive stack to handle everything from data collection and storage to live broadcasting and interactive visualizations. The entire platform is accessible as a Progressive Web App, making it easy to view current weather insights from any device.",
